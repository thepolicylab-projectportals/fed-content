Evaluation.gov seeks partners from a wide range of disciplines, reflecting the fact that needs are varied as are the backgrounds and expertise needed to address those needs. Where possible, project summaries include information about what types of expertise are likely needed but if you have an idea for how to contribute that is different or not stated in the summary, please let us know.\n\nAfter Evaluation.gov collects expressions of interest, agency partners, research partners, and Evaluation.gov work together to determine fit and how to best approach the project. Evaluation.gov prioritizes partnerships that are scalable, sustainable, and develop public, open-source resources.\n\nTo learn more about how Evaluation.gov facilitates cross-sector partnerships visit [Evaluation.gov](https://www.evaluation.gov)."

      "title": "Are these opportunities open to students?",
      "text": "Yes, for some projects. If you're a student interested in a project, we encourage you to express your interest even if you're unsure whether your expertise is a good fit. The needs of the agency along with research partner input, determine what type of expertise will fit best for each project."

      "title": "Can multiple people or organizations work on a project?",
      "text": "Yes. Needs vary from project to project with respect to scope, expertise needed, timeline, and other factors. OSP encourages people within or across organizations to work collaboratively when feasible. If you are interested in working with one or more collaborators but have not identified them, please contact OSP at [partnerships@osbm.nc.gov](mailto:partnerships@osbm.nc.gov)."

      "title": "Is there funding for projects?",
      "text": "It depends. The availability of funding (if needed) varies from project to project. OSP, agency partners, and research partners work together to determine if a project has costs, what funding may be available, and possibilities for pursuing funding, if needed."

    {
      "title": "What kind of data are available?",
      "text": "It depends. Projects with data components may involve qualitative and quantitative data. Data may already be collected or it may need to be collected. OSP, agency partners, and research partners work together to assess what data would advance a project and, in turn, whether and how to collect and share it."

    {
      "title": "Can I propose a project idea?",
      "text": "Yes! OSP welcomes ideas for government-research partnerships or other cross-sector collaborative opportunities. If you have a project idea, please email [partnerships@osbm.nc.gov](mailto:partnerships@osbm.nc.gov) with a brief description of your proposed project. The description should include, at a minimum, a project overview, how the results would benefit North Carolinians, and an estimated timeline."
